Service Mesh Hub can automatically discover service mesh installations on registered clusters using control plane and sidecar discovery, as well as workloads and services exposed through the service mesh.

In this guide we will learn about the four main discovery capabilities in the context of Kubernetes as the compute platform:

1. **Kubernetes Clusters**
    - Representation of a cluster that Service Mesh Hub is aware of and is authorized to talk to its Kubernetes API server
    - *note*: this resource is created by `meshctl` at cluster registration time
2. **Meshes**
    - Representation of a service mesh control plane that has been discovered 
3. **Workloads**
    - Representation of a pod that is a member of a service mesh; this is often determined by the presence of an injected proxy sidecar
4. **TrafficTargets**
    - Representation of a Kubernetes service that is backed by Workload pods, e.g. pods that are a member of the service mesh


## Before you begin
To illustrate these concepts, we will assume that:

* Service Mesh Hub is [installed and running on the `management-cluster`]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/setup/#install-service-mesh-hub" %}})
* Istio is [installed on both the `management-cluster` and `remote-cluster`]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/installing_istio" %}})
* Both `management-cluster` and `remote-cluster` clusters are [registered with Service Mesh Hub]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/#two-registered-clusters" %}})
* The `bookinfo` app is [installed into the two clusters]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/#bookinfo-deployed-on-two-clusters" %}})


{{% notice note %}}
Be sure to review the assumptions and satisfy the pre-requisites from the [Guides]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides" %}}) top-level document.

### Discover Kubernetes Clusters

Ensure that your `kubeconfig` has the correct context set as its `currentContext`:

```shell
MGMT_CONTEXT=your_management_plane_context
REMOTE_CONTEXT=your_remote_context
kubectl config use-context $MGMT_CONTEXT
```

Validate that the cluster have been registered by checking for `KubernetesClusters` custom resources:

```shell
kubectl get kubernetesclusters -n service-mesh-hub
```

```shell
NAME                 AGE
management-cluster   23h
remote-cluster       23h
```

### Discover Meshes

Check to see that Istio has been discovered:

```shell
meshctl describe mesh
```

```

We can print it in YAML form to see all the information we discovered:

```shell
kubectl -n service-mesh-hub get mesh istiod-istio-system-remote-cluster -oyaml
```

(snipped for brevity)

### Discover Workloads

Check to see that the `bookinfo` pods have been correctly identified as Workloads:

```shell
kubectl -n service-mesh-hub get workloads
```

```
NAME                                                            AGE

```

### Discover Traffic Targets

Similarly for the `bookinfo` services:

```shell
kubectl -n service-mesh-hub get traffictargets
```

```
NAME                                                 AGE

## Next Steps

Now that we have Istio installed, and we've seen Service Mesh Hub discover the meshes across different clusters, we can now unify them into a single [Virtual Mesh]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/virtual_mesh/" %}}). See the guide on [establishing shared trust domain for multiple meshes]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/federate_identity" %}}).
