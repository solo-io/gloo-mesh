### CertificateRequestSpec
CertificateRequests are generated by the CertificateRequesting Agent installed on managed clusters. They are used to request a signed certificate from Service Mesh Hub based on a private key generated by the Agent (which never leaves the managed cluster).<br>When Service Mesh Hub creates an IssuedCertificate on a managed cluster, the local CertificateRequesting Agent will generate a CertificateRequest corresponding to it.<br>Service Mesh Hub will then process the Certificate Signing Request contained in the CertificateRequestSpec, and write the signed SSL certificate back as a secret in the managed cluster, and the CertificateRequest Status to point to that secret.
