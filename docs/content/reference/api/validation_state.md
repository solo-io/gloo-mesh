### ApprovalState
State of a Policy resource reflected in the status by Service Mesh Hub while processing a resource.

| Name | Number | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| PENDING | 0 | Resources are in a Pending state before they have been processed by Service Mesh Hub. |
| ACCEPTED | 1 | Resources are in a Accepted state when they are valid and have been applied successfully to the Service Mesh Hub configuration. |
| INVALID | 2 | Resources are in an Invalid state when they contain incorrect configuration parameters, such as missing required values or invalid resource references. An invalid state can also result when a resource's configuration is valid but conflicts with another resource which was accepted in an earlier point in time. |
| FAILED | 3 | Resources are in a Failed state when they contain correct configuration parameters, but the server encountered an error trying to synchronize the system to the desired state. |
