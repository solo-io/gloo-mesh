# A Multi Mesh Management Tool

## What is Service Mesh Hub

Service Mesh Hub is a Kubernetes-native **management plane** that enables configuration 
and operational management of multiple heterogeneous service meshes across multiple 
clusters through a unified API. The Service Mesh Hub API integrates with the leading 
service meshes and  abstracts away differences between their disparate API's, allowing 
users to configure a set of different service meshes through a single API. Service 
Mesh Hub is engineered with a focus on its utility as an operational management 
tool, providing both graphical and command line UIs, observability features, and 
debugging tools.
