# A Multi Mesh Management Tool

## What is Gloo Mesh

Gloo Mesh is a Kubernetes-native **management plane** that enables configuration 
and operational management of multiple heterogeneous service meshes across multiple 
clusters through a unified API. The Gloo Mesh API integrates with the leading 
service meshes and  abstracts away differences between their disparate API's, allowing 
users to configure a set of different service meshes through a single API. Service 
Mesh Hub is engineered with a focus on its utility as an operational management 
tool, providing both graphical and command line UIs, observability features, and 
debugging tools.

### Getting to know Gloo Mesh

![Gloo Mesh Architecture]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/gloomesh-3clusters.png" %}})

Gloo Mesh can be run in its own cluster (or co-located with an existing mesh) and remotely operates and drives the configuration for specific service-mesh control planes. This allows Gloo Mesh to discover meshes/workloads, establish federated identity, enable global traffic routing and load balancing, access control policy, centralized observability and more. We walk through each of these components in the following videos:

### Videos: Take a dive into Gloo Mesh

We've put together [a handful of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sWikVELr5M&list=PLBOtlFtGznBjr4E9xYHH9eVyiOwnk1ciK) detailing the features of Gloo Mesh.
