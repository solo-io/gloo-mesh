# A Multi Mesh Management Tool

## What is Service Mesh Hub

Service Mesh Hub is a Kubernetes-native **management plane** that enables configuration 
and operational management of multiple heterogeneous service meshes across multiple 
clusters through a unified API. The Service Mesh Hub API integrates with the leading 
service meshes and  abstracts away differences between their disparate API's, allowing 
users to configure a set of different service meshes through a single API. Service 
Mesh Hub is engineered with a focus on its utility as an operational management 
tool, providing both graphical and command line UIs, observability features, and 
debugging tools.

### Getting to know Service Mesh Hub

![Service Mesh Hub Architecture]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/smh-3clusters.png" %}})

Service Mesh Hub can be run in its own cluster (or co-located with an existing mesh) and remotely operates and drives the configuration for specific service-mesh control planes. This allows Service Mesh Hub to discover meshes/workloads, establish federated identity, enable global traffic routing and load balancing, access control policy, centralized observability and more. We walk through each of these components in the following videos:

### Videos: Take a dive into Service Mesh Hub

We've put together [a handful of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sWikVELr5M&list=PLBOtlFtGznBjr4E9xYHH9eVyiOwnk1ciK) detailing the features of Service Mesh Hub.
