### <a name="VirtualService">VirtualService</a>

 
A `VirtualService` defines a set of traffic routing rules to apply when a host is
addressed. Each routing rule defines matching criteria for traffic of a specific
protocol. If the traffic is matched, then it is sent to a named destination service
(or subset/version of it) defined in the registry.

The source of traffic can also be matched in a routing rule. This allows routing
to be customized for specific client contexts.

The following example on Kubernetes, routes all HTTP traffic by default to
pods of the reviews service with label "version: v1". In addition,
HTTP requests with path starting with /wpcatalog/ or /consumercatalog/ will
be rewritten to /newcatalog and sent to pods with label "version: v2".


```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: "/wpcatalog"
    - uri:
        prefix: "/consumercatalog"
    rewrite:
      uri: "/newcatalog"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v1
```

A subset/version of a route destination is identified with a reference
to a named service subset which must be declared in a corresponding
`DestinationRule`.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews-destination
spec:
  host: reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
```

```yaml
"status": .core.solo.io.Status
"metadata": .core.solo.io.Metadata
"hosts": []string
"gateways": []string
"http": []istio.networking.v1alpha3.HTTPRoute
"tls": []istio.networking.v1alpha3.TLSRoute
"tcp": []istio.networking.v1alpha3.TCPRoute
"config_scope": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConfigScope

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `status` | [.core.solo.io.Status](../../../../../../../solo-kit/api/v1/status.proto.sk#Status) | Status indicates the validation status of this resource. Status is read-only by clients, and set by supergloo during validation |  |
| `metadata` | [.core.solo.io.Metadata](../../../../../../../solo-kit/api/v1/metadata.proto.sk#Metadata) | Metadata contains the object metadata for this resource |  |
| `hosts` | `[]string` | REQUIRED. The destination hosts to which traffic is being sent. Could be a DNS name with wildcard prefix or an IP address. Depending on the platform, short-names can also be used instead of a FQDN (i.e. has no dots in the name). In such a scenario, the FQDN of the host would be derived based on the underlying platform. **A host name can be defined by only one VirtualService**. A single VirtualService can be used to describe traffic properties for multiple HTTP and TCP ports. *Note for Kubernetes users*: When short names are used (e.g. "reviews" instead of "reviews.default.svc.cluster.local"), Istio will interpret the short name based on the namespace of the rule, not the service. A rule in the "default" namespace containing a host "reviews will be interpreted as "reviews.default.svc.cluster.local", irrespective of the actual namespace associated with the reviews service. _To avoid potential misconfigurations, it is recommended to always use fully qualified domain names over short names._ The hosts field applies to both HTTP and TCP services. Service inside the mesh, i.e., those found in the service registry, must always be referred to using their alphanumeric names. IP addresses are allowed only for services defined via the Gateway. |  |
| `gateways` | `[]string` | The names of gateways and sidecars that should apply these routes. A single VirtualService is used for sidecars inside the mesh as well as for one or more gateways. The selection condition imposed by this field can be overridden using the source field in the match conditions of protocol-specific routes. The reserved word `mesh` is used to imply all the sidecars in the mesh. When this field is omitted, the default gateway (`mesh`) will be used, which would apply the rule to all sidecars in the mesh. If a list of gateway names is provided, the rules will apply only to the gateways. To apply the rules to both gateways and sidecars, specify `mesh` as one of the gateway names. |  |
| `http` | [[]istio.networking.v1alpha3.HTTPRoute](../virtual_service.proto.sk#HTTPRoute) | An ordered list of route rules for HTTP traffic. HTTP routes will be applied to platform service ports named 'http-*'/'http2-*'/'grpc-*', gateway ports with protocol HTTP/HTTP2/GRPC/ TLS-terminated-HTTPS and service entry ports using HTTP/HTTP2/GRPC protocols. The first rule matching an incoming request is used. |  |
| `tls` | [[]istio.networking.v1alpha3.TLSRoute](../virtual_service.proto.sk#TLSRoute) | An ordered list of route rule for non-terminated TLS & HTTPS traffic. Routing is typically performed using the SNI value presented by the ClientHello message. TLS routes will be applied to platform service ports named 'https-*', 'tls-*', unterminated gateway ports using HTTPS/TLS protocols (i.e. with "passthrough" TLS mode) and service entry ports using HTTPS/TLS protocols. The first rule matching an incoming request is used. NOTE: Traffic 'https-*' or 'tls-*' ports without associated virtual service will be treated as opaque TCP traffic. |  |
| `tcp` | [[]istio.networking.v1alpha3.TCPRoute](../virtual_service.proto.sk#TCPRoute) | An ordered list of route rules for opaque TCP traffic. TCP routes will be applied to any port that is not a HTTP or TLS port. The first rule matching an incoming request is used. |  |
| `config_scope` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.ConfigScope](../sidecar.proto.sk#ConfigScope) | The visibility setting associated with this VirtualService. Set to PRIVATE if this virtual service should not be exported, i.e. restrict the applicability of this virtual service to only workloads in the same namespace as the virtual service. |  |




---
### <a name="Destination">Destination</a>

 
Destination indicates the network addressable service to which the
request/connection will be sent after processing a routing rule. The
destination.host should unambiguously refer to a service in the service
registry. Istio's service registry is composed of all the services found
in the platform's service registry (e.g., Kubernetes services, Consul
services), as well as services declared through the
[ServiceEntry](#ServiceEntry) resource.

*Note for Kubernetes users*: When short names are used (e.g. "reviews"
instead of "reviews.default.svc.cluster.local"), Istio will interpret
the short name based on the namespace of the rule, not the service. A
rule in the "default" namespace containing a host "reviews will be
interpreted as "reviews.default.svc.cluster.local", irrespective of the
actual namespace associated with the reviews service. _To avoid potential
misconfigurations, it is recommended to always use fully qualified
domain names over short names._

The following Kubernetes example routes all traffic by default to pods
of the reviews service with label "version: v1" (i.e., subset v1), and
some to subset v2, in a kubernetes environment.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
  namespace: foo
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews # interpreted as reviews.foo.svc.cluster.local
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: "/wpcatalog"
    - uri:
        prefix: "/consumercatalog"
    rewrite:
      uri: "/newcatalog"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews # interpreted as reviews.foo.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews # interpreted as reviews.foo.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v1
```

And the associated DestinationRule

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews-destination
  namespace: foo
spec:
  host: reviews # interpreted as reviews.foo.svc.cluster.local
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
```

The following VirtualService sets a timeout of 5s for all calls to
productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local service in Kubernetes. Notice that
there are no subsets defined in this rule. Istio will fetch all
instances of productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local service from the service
registry and populate the sidecar's load balancing pool. Also, notice
that this rule is set in the istio-system namespace but uses the fully
qualified domain name of the productpage service,
productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local. Therefore the rule's namespace does
not have an impact in resolving the name of the productpage service.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-productpage-rule
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  hosts:
  - productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local # ignores rule namespace
  http:
  - timeout: 5s
    route:
    - destination:
        host: productpage.prod.svc.cluster.local
```

To control routing for traffic bound to services outside the mesh, external
services must first be added to Istio's internal service registry using the
ServiceEntry resource. VirtualServices can then be defined to control traffic
bound to these external services. For example, the following rules define a
Service for wikipedia.org and set a timeout of 5s for http requests.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: external-svc-wikipedia
spec:
  hosts:
  - wikipedia.org
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  ports:
  - number: 80
    name: example-http
    protocol: HTTP
  resolution: DNS

apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-wiki-rule
spec:
  hosts:
  - wikipedia.org
  http:
  - timeout: 5s
    route:
    - destination:
        host: wikipedia.org
```

```yaml
"host": string
"subset": string
"port": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.PortSelector

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `host` | `string` | REQUIRED. The name of a service from the service registry. Service names are looked up from the platform's service registry (e.g., Kubernetes services, Consul services, etc.) and from the hosts declared by [ServiceEntry](#ServiceEntry). Traffic forwarded to destinations that are not found in either of the two, will be dropped. *Note for Kubernetes users*: When short names are used (e.g. "reviews" instead of "reviews.default.svc.cluster.local"), Istio will interpret the short name based on the namespace of the rule, not the service. A rule in the "default" namespace containing a host "reviews will be interpreted as "reviews.default.svc.cluster.local", irrespective of the actual namespace associated with the reviews service. _To avoid potential misconfigurations, it is recommended to always use fully qualified domain names over short names._ |  |
| `subset` | `string` | The name of a subset within the service. Applicable only to services within the mesh. The subset must be defined in a corresponding DestinationRule. |  |
| `port` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.PortSelector](../virtual_service.proto.sk#PortSelector) | Specifies the port on the host that is being addressed. If a service exposes only a single port it is not required to explicitly select the port. |  |

All conditions inside a single match block have AND semantics, while the list of match blocks have OR semantics. The rule is matched if any one of the match blocks succeed. |  |
| `route` | [[]istio.networking.v1alpha3.HTTPRouteDestination](../virtual_service.proto.sk#HTTPRouteDestination) | A http rule can either redirect or forward (default) traffic. The forwarding target can be one of several versions of a service (see glossary in beginning of document). Weights associated with the service version determine the proportion of traffic it receives. |  |
| `redirect` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.HTTPRedirect](../virtual_service.proto.sk#HTTPRedirect) | A http rule can either redirect or forward (default) traffic. If traffic passthrough option is specified in the rule, route/redirect will be ignored. The redirect primitive can be used to send a HTTP 301 redirect to a different URI or Authority. |  |
| `rewrite` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.HTTPRewrite](../virtual_service.proto.sk#HTTPRewrite) | Rewrite HTTP URIs and Authority headers. Rewrite cannot be used with Redirect primitive. Rewrite will be performed before forwarding. |  |

---
### <a name="HTTPMatchRequest">HTTPMatchRequest</a>

 
HttpMatchRequest specifies a set of criterion to be met in order for the
rule to be applied to the HTTP request. For example, the following
restricts the rule to match only requests where the URL path
starts with /ratings/v2/ and the request contains a custom `end-user` header
with value `jason`.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: ratings-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - ratings.prod.svc.cluster.local
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        end-user:
          exact: jason
      uri:
        prefix: "/ratings/v2/"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: ratings.prod.svc.cluster.local
```

HTTPMatchRequest CANNOT be empty.

```yaml
"uri": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.StringMatch
"scheme": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.StringMatch
"method": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.StringMatch

"headers": map<string, .istio.networking.v1alpha3.StringMatch>
"port": int
"source_labels": map<string, string>
"gateways": []string

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `uri` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.StringMatch](../virtual_service.proto.sk#StringMatch) | URI to match values are case-sensitive and formatted as follows: - `exact: "value"` for exact string match - `prefix: "value"` for prefix-based match - `regex: "value"` for ECMAscript style regex-based match |  |
| `scheme` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.StringMatch](../virtual_service.proto.sk#StringMatch) | URI Scheme values are case-sensitive and formatted as follows: - `exact: "value"` for exact string match - `prefix: "value"` for prefix-based match - `regex: "value"` for ECMAscript style regex-based match |  |
| `method` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.StringMatch](../virtual_service.proto.sk#StringMatch) | HTTP Method values are case-sensitive and formatted as follows: - `exact: "value"` for exact string match - `prefix: "value"` for prefix-based match - `regex: "value"` for ECMAscript style regex-based match |  |
| `authority` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.StringMatch](../virtual_service.proto.sk#StringMatch) | HTTP Authority values are case-sensitive and formatted as follows: - `exact: "value"` for exact string match - `prefix: "value"` for prefix-based match - `regex: "value"` for ECMAscript style regex-based match |  |
| `headers` | `map<string, .istio.networking.v1alpha3.StringMatch>` | The header keys must be lowercase and use hyphen as the separator, e.g. _x-request-id_. Header values are case-sensitive and formatted as follows: - `exact: "value"` for exact string match - `prefix: "value"` for prefix-based match - `regex: "value"` for ECMAscript style regex-based match **Note:** The keys `uri`, `scheme`, `method`, and `authority` will be ignored. |  |
| `port` | `int` | Specifies the ports on the host that is being addressed. Many services only expose a single port or label ports with the protocols they support, in these cases it is not required to explicitly select the port. |  |
| `source_labels` | `map<string, string>` | One or more labels that constrain the applicability of a rule to workloads with the given labels. If the VirtualService has a list of gateways specified at the top, it should include the reserved gateway `mesh` in order for this field to be applicable. |  |
| `gateways` | `[]string` | Names of gateways where the rule should be applied to. Gateway names at the top of the VirtualService (if any) are overridden. The gateway match is independent of sourceLabels. |  |

### <a name="HTTPRouteDestination">HTTPRouteDestination</a>

 
Each routing rule is associated with one or more service versions (see
glossary in beginning of document). Weights associated with the version
determine the proportion of traffic it receives. For example, the
following rule will route 25% of traffic for the "reviews" service to
instances with the "v2" tag and the remaining traffic (i.e., 75%) to
"v1".

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v2
      weight: 25
    - destination:
        host: reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v1
      weight: 75
```

And the associated DestinationRule

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews-destination
spec:
  host: reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
```

Traffic can also be split across two entirely different services without
having to define new subsets. For example, the following rule forwards 25% of
traffic to reviews.com to dev.reviews.com

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route-two-domains
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews.com
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: dev.reviews.com

### <a name="HTTPRewrite">HTTPRewrite</a>

 
HTTPRewrite can be used to rewrite specific parts of a HTTP request
before forwarding the request to the destination. Rewrite primitive can
be used only with HTTPRouteDestination. The following example
demonstrates how to rewrite the URL prefix for api call (/ratings) to
ratings service before making the actual API call.

```yaml

### <a name="CorsPolicy">CorsPolicy</a>

 
Describes the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy, for a given
service. Refer to
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS>
for further details about cross origin resource sharing. For example,
the following rule restricts cross origin requests to those originating
from example.com domain using HTTP POST/GET, and sets the
`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header to false. In addition, it only
exposes `X-Foo-bar` header and sets an expiry period of 1 day.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: ratings-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - ratings.prod.svc.cluster.local
  http:

Translates to `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header. |  |




---
### <a name="HTTPFaultInjection">HTTPFaultInjection</a>

 
HTTPFaultInjection can be used to specify one or more faults to inject
while forwarding http requests to the destination specified in a route.
Fault specification is part of a VirtualService rule. Faults include
aborting the Http request from downstream service, and/or delaying
proxying of requests. A fault rule MUST HAVE delay or abort or both.

*Note:* Delay and abort faults are independent of one another, even if
both are specified simultaneously.

```yaml
"delay": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.HTTPFaultInjection.Delay
"abort": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.HTTPFaultInjection.Abort

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `delay` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.HTTPFaultInjection.Delay](../virtual_service.proto.sk#Delay) | Delay requests before forwarding, emulating various failures such as network issues, overloaded upstream service, etc. |  |
| `abort` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.HTTPFaultInjection.Abort](../virtual_service.proto.sk#Abort) | Abort Http request attempts and return error codes back to downstream service, giving the impression that the upstream service is faulty. |  |




---
### <a name="Delay">Delay</a>

 
Delay specification is used to inject latency into the request
forwarding path. The following example will introduce a 5 second delay
in 1 out of every 1000 requests to the "v1" version of the "reviews"
service from all pods with label env: prod

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
  http:
  - match:
    - sourceLabels:
        env: prod
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v1
    fault:
      delay:
        percentage:
          value: 0.001
        fixedDelay: 5s
```

The _fixedDelay_ field is used to indicate the amount of delay in seconds.
The optional _percentage_ field can be used to only delay a certain
percentage of requests. If left unspecified, all request will be delayed.

```yaml
"percent": int
"fixed_delay": .google.protobuf.Duration
"exponential_delay": .google.protobuf.Duration
"percentage": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.Percent

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| `percent` | `int` | Percentage of requests on which the delay will be injected (0-100). Use of integer `percent` value is deprecated. Use the double `percentage` field instead. |  |
| `fixed_delay` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | REQUIRED. Add a fixed delay before forwarding the request. Format: 1h/1m/1s/1ms. MUST be >=1ms. |  |
| `exponential_delay` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | $hide_from_docs |  |
| `percentage` | [.istio.networking.v1alpha3.Percent](../virtual_service.proto.sk#Percent) | Percentage of requests on which the delay will be injected. |  |




---
### <a name="Abort">Abort</a>

 
Abort specification is used to prematurely abort a request with a
pre-specified error code. The following example will return an HTTP 400
error code for 1 out of every 1000 requests to the "ratings" service "v1".

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: ratings-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - ratings.prod.svc.cluster.local
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: ratings.prod.svc.cluster.local
        subset: v1
    fault:
      abort:
        percentage:
          value: 0.001
        httpStatus: 400
```

The _httpStatus_ field is used to indicate the HTTP status code to
return to the caller. The optional _percentage_ field can be used to only
abort a certain percentage of requests. If not specified, all requests are
aborted.

```yaml
"percent": int
"http_status": int
"grpc_status": string
"http2_error": string
"percentage": .istio.networking.v1alpha3.Percent

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- |
