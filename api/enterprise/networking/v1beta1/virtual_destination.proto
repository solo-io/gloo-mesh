/*
    A VirtualDestination creates a new hostname to which client workloads can send requests.
    The hostname abstracts over a set of underlying Destinations and provides failover functionality between them.
    Failover order is determined by either an explicitly defined priority (`static`), or a list of locality directives (`localized`).

    Each Destination backing the VirtualDestination must be configured with a
    [TrafficPolicy's outlier detection]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com.solo-io.gloo-mesh.api.networking.v1.traffic_policy/" >}}).
    Currently this feature only supports Destinations backed by Istio.
