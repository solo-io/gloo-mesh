    A FailoverService creates a new hostname to which services can send requests.
    Requests will be routed based on a list of backing services ordered by
    decreasing priority. When outlier detection detects that a service in the list is
    in an unhealthy state, requests sent to the FailoverService will be routed
    to the next healthy service in the list. For each service referenced in the
    failover services list, outlier detection must be configured using a TrafficPolicy.

    Currently this feature only supports Services backed by Istio.
