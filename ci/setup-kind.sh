# Set up two kind clusters:
#   1. a master cluster in which Service Mesh Hub is installed.
#   2. a remote cluster in which only Istio and the bookinfo app are installed.
#
# The master cluster will have the appropriate secret for communicating with the remote cluster
# Your kube context will be left pointing to the master cluster
# Each cluster will have Istio set up in the istio-system namespace in its minimal profile
#
# To clean up your kind clusters, run this script as: `bash ci/setup-kind.sh cleanup`. Use this if you notice the docker VM running out of disk space (for images).
