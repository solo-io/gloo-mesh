Description: 

```yaml
"tlsEnabled": bool
"secret": .core.solo.io.ResourceRef

```

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |----------- | 
| tlsEnabled | bool | If set to true, TLS is enabled across the entire mesh. |  |
| secret | [.core.solo.io.ResourceRef](encryption.proto.sk.md#Encryption) | This is a ref to a secret that should have at least ca-cert.pem and ca-key.pem fields. The expected format is the same as defined in github.com/solo-io/supergloo/pkg2/api/external/istio/encryption/v1/secret.proto If deploying to Consul, Consul Connect requires that the cert and key are generated using ec, not rsa. If tlsEnabled is not true, this won't be used. |  |
