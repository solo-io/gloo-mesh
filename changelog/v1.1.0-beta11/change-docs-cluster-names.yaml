    description: >
      Rename most instances of 'mgmt' and 'remote' contexts and clusters in docs to 1 and 2.
      The few exceptions that remain are for contexts where the distinction matters, and for
      values produced from meshctl, which still uses 'mgmt' and 'remote' and its default naming.
