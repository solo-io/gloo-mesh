    description: >-
      Fix a potential bug in the generated istio virtual service when using a traffic policy that selects a kubernetes
      service that itself has several ports. Before this fix, the generated virtual service did not have an istio
      `HttpMatchRequest` for each port, so HTTP requests would always match the first route on the virtual service
      (which might have the wrong port) rather than the correct route.
