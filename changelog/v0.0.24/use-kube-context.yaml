  description: >
    Currently meshctl uses the flags --master-kube-config and --master-write-namespace
    to specify how and where objects are written to the cluster. This PR will shift the paradigm
    to follow most other kube related CLIs and use the --kubeconfig, --context, and --namespace flags.
    Also, the multicluster commands are currently using multiple kubeconfigs for configuration,
    when the trend seems to be using seperate contexts, rather than config files, so we have moved to this as
    well.
