# Traffic Policy Translation

## Problem Summary

Traffic Policies go through two rounds of validation:

1. Individual validation
    - eg ensure no negative retry rates
1. Merge validation
    - eg ensure no conflicting retry policies across multiple different Traffic Policies that apply to the same target (Istio) or source (AppMesh)

See the file `tp_conflict_example.jpg` in this directory for an example of a conflict.

Handling these validation failures is complicated by the fact that multiple Traffic Policies can impact
the same translated resource, like an Istio Virtual Service.

We need to decide how to handle validation failures in a way that does not involve destructively mutating
generated service mesh configuration when one or more traffic policies gets into an invalid state. We also
want to prevent an invalid Traffic Policy from invalidating all the other Traffic Policies that impact the same
translated resource. To state it another way, we want to ensure that if a single Traffic Policy is invalid,
other (valid) Traffic Policies can continue to be updated and translated successfully. 

## Proposed Design

We propose introducing a new field on our MeshServiceStatus subresource:

```proto
message MeshServiceStatus {
    
    ...

    message ValidatedTrafficPolicy {
        string name = 1;
        string namespace = 2;

        // this essentially records the last known good state of the user-written traffic policy
        TrafficPolicySpec traffic_policy_spec = 3;
    }

    ...

    // the validated traffic policies which have this mesh service as a destination
    repeated ValidatedTrafficPolicy validated_traffic_policies = 2;
}
```

The new semantics of Traffic Policy translation are as follows:

1. User writes or updates a Traffic Policy
1. (Eventually, we will validate that Traffic Policy at this point in a validating admission webhook to prevent invalid
Traffic Policies from even being written to the persistence layer. However, this is not a complete solution,
since a) not all large enterprises can allow webhooks (eg those running Openshift), and b) webhooks don't
address resources that are already written to the cluster while a Service Mesh Hub upgrade happens, which may
change Traffic Policy semantics)
1. That Traffic Policy state gets written to the persistence layer
1. It gets picked up by the `mesh-networking` pod, at which point:
    - individual validation on the Traffic Policy in isolation occurs (eg standalone data validation, like no negative retry rates)
        - if individual validation fails, write that to the object and stop
        - otherwise, write a "validated" status onto the Traffic Policy
    - a separate reconciler, watching only for Traffic Policies with a "validated" status, picks up that Traffic Policy
        - this reconciler determines which mesh service(s) the validated traffic policy applies to, and looks up all
        the relevant `MeshService`s.
        - for each one of those `MeshService`s, it checks whether the validated Traffic Policy
        can be merged with the other Traffic Policies already recorded on the service's status. If the Traffic Policy existed
        already and is already present in the `validated_traffic_policies` list, then consider the rest of the list together with its new state.
        - if merging fails for any one of those IRs, we stop and record a "merge failure" error onto the user-written Traffic Policy
        - otherwise, for each service, we add the user-written traffic policy definition in with the others on that status list (or update
        the spec we had recorded previously, if this traffic policy's name/namespace is already found in the `validated_traffic_policies` list.
        Note that no merging happens at this stage. We record all the traffic policies here as they were written
1. Yet another reconciler in `mesh-networking` watches for updates to `MeshService`s.
When a new update rolls in, it merges the traffic policies in-memory and re-generates translated mesh configuration from that mesh service.

The advantages of this approach are that:
1. Mesh configuration translation does not have to be aware of any validation. It always processes valid resources
1. A single user writing an invalid Traffic Policy will not prevent other Traffic Policies from being accepted and translated
1. A valid Traffic Policy that gets updated into an invalid state will not affect the IR. Either the individual validation
will fail, or the merging will fail; in either case, we do not update the IR.
1. We can later add a similar field onto MeshWorkload statuses, when we eventually need to for App Mesh translation.
  
## Expected Concerns and Mitigating Solutions

There is always some added complexity when introducing a new abstraction. Since the user will very rarely
have to be aware of this abstraction, we think the cognitive load may be low.
